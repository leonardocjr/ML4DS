### Host (Winter Term 2025/26)
Universidad de La Laguna (ULL) 
(www.ull.es) 

### Duration
60 contact hours | 162 total hours 

The subject is scheduled for the winter semester, from October to January, with the mobility week in 
the third week of January, according to the table below. 

## 2. Description and contents of the course
The BIP will have three months of virtual components to present the contents of the course. The main objective is to develop skills and knowledge regarding several modern machine learning techniques that have application in data science problems. 
The program is structured in different sessions along the semester that cover:  
- Data Science Process;
- Machine learning basics;
- Model selection and evaluation;
- Neural networks;
- Advanced models;
- Data stream analysis Applications;
- Further trends and needs. 

### Learning outcome
The main objective is to develop skills and knowledge regarding several modern machine learning techniques and apply them to a practical problem. The students should be able to carry out the typical steps of a data science project: 
- analyzing the application problem;
- apply appropriate preprocessing to the data;
- select and apply appropriate machine learning methods, and evaluate the quality of the models developed and interpret the results obtained.

The contents of the course are:

1. Introduction to big data, KDD process, and data life cycle
2. Introduction to machine learning: problem types and learning principles
3. Regression models
4. Model selection and evaluation
5. Introduction to neural networks
6. Deep learning, convolutional neural networks for image classification and object detection
7. Advanced NN models for time series analysis
8. Applications
9. Further trends in AI.
